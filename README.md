# React-testing-practice

"CopyCat" is a very simple React app built to allow me to practice writing End-to-end and unit tests with React Testing Library and Jest. The project was uploaded in one commit because I originally created it in the CodeCademy IDE and wanted to rebuild it in VSCode before uploading it on here.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
